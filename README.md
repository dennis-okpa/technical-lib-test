# Seenit Library Technical Test

- Hello, we'd like you to create a Library displaying multiple videos and images.
- Design link: https://zpl.io/VkPjq8K . You'll have to login and make you sure you've been added to the project.
- We'd love you to be creative, use latest technologies and 3rd parties if needed, and of course, we want to see your testing strategy.

## API

This endpoint gives access to authorised users to view some sample data for the purpose of Seenit Technical tests.

### Available end points

This API requests 50 records by default. However, you can change this by calling the above with the following query parameters.

```

    minimum = 1
    maximum = 100
```

E.g.

```

Only authorised email addresses are allowed, make sure you've been added to the whitelist before.
